            <h1>This Is NGDC</h1>
            <h2>It's a part of national university college</h2>
            <h4>The teacher of <span class="name-color">Shib Shankar</span> is love this university</h4>

            <h5>Student opinon:-
            </h5>
            <p>Actually,honestly speaking,I think there has no available good teacher at physics
                Depertment like Shib
                Shankar sir.End of the day every student wants to need help to teacher.but most of the case student find
                that "Only Shib Shankar sir help the student accroding their problem and other teacher avoid this
                topic.so people don't know.why are they avoid student problem. It's a painful to every student.Beacuse
                all of them want to more learn.But this is not possible for <span class="name-color">shankar's</span>
                alone.So student of therefore pray and hope that they need more good teacher at physics depertment.</p>
